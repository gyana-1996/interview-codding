3. What will happen if System.exit(0); is written inside a try block? Will the finally block execute in this case? Explain with an example.
	Answer - If System.exit() is called inside a try block, the finally block will not execute because System.exit() terminates the JVM immediately, preventing any further execution.
	public class ExitExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println("Inside try block");
            System.exit(0);  // JVM terminates here
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Inside finally block");  // This will NOT execute
        }
    }
}
